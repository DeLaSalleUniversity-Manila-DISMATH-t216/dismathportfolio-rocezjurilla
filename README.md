#Week 1:
* I don't have too much idea about this course but I knew it was about Logic. 
* I was excited to take this course because this is quite different from other Math courses I took, and this subject won't be dealing with too much numbers.
* My first impression of this class is fun because our professor is very interactive to his students. 
* The introduction of Sir Melvin made me more excited since the problems he gave are very tricky but interesting.
* We discussed some basic topics about logic and so far, I caught up.
* This week, we already started discussing the formal lecture since we're done with the introductions.
* We first defined some important terms like proof, proposition, axiom and more.
* I learned that a proposition is a statement either true or false. 
* We also learned about the logical connectives:
| Logical Symbol  |  Logical Operator | Shorthand | Formula | Logical Expression |
| :-----: |:-------:|:-----:| :-------: | :-------: |
| ¬ |Negation | not | val(¬p) = 1 - val(p) | ¬p |
| ∧ | Conjunction | and | val(p ∧ q) = min(val(p), val(q)) | p ∧ q |
| v | Disjunction | or | val(p v q) = max(val(p), val(q)) | p v q |
| ⊕ | Exclusive disjunction | xor | if val(p)  not equal val(q) = 1 , otherwise  0|  p ⊕ q  ≡ (¬p ∧ q) v (p ∧ ¬q) |
| → | Conditional | if, then | if val(p)  ≤ val(q) = 1 , otherwise  0  | p → q ≡  ¬p v q |
| ↔ | Biconditional | iff | if val(p) equals val(q) = 1 , otherwise  0 |  p ↔ q ≡ (p → q) ∧ (q → p) |
* Each operator requires a truth table to see if it's valid. I really like making truth tables since the moment I learned how to make one.

#Week 2:
* This week, we have already started discussing logical equivalences.
* I somewhat remembered the laws that we had during our engalg and engtrig courses.
* Proving was not easy since you really need to be familiar with the laws like Identity, Domination, Negation, Double Negation, Idempotent, Commutative, Associative, Distributive, De Morgan's and Absorption. 
* However, it may seem be fun if you know how to relate each statement with each other to prove its validity.
* I realized that I need more practice to completely comprehend this topic. The superman homework was very helpful because it challenged me to apply the laws that I've learned. 
* The Rules of Inference was also discussed this week and it's somehow similar to the laws:
  - Modus Ponens
  - Modus Tollens
  - Hypothetical Syllogism
  - Disjunctive Syllogism
  - Addition
  - Simplification
  - Conjunction
  - Resolution
* We also tackled the Universal and Existential Qualifier.
